Project: Smart Plant Monitoring & Irrigation System using ESP32 + Blynk + DHT22 + Soil Moisture Sensor + LCD + Relay

---

### Project Overview:

This Smart Plant Monitoring and Irrigation System automates water pumping based on soil moisture levels and provides real-time environmental monitoring using an ESP32, DHT22 sensor, and Blynk IoT platform. It displays temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and pump status on a 16x2 I2C LCD and the Blynk dashboard. Users can switch between auto and manual irrigation modes remotely via Blynk.

### Arduino Code Setup:

1. Install these libraries in Arduino IDE:
   - `Blynk` (v1)
   - `DHT sensor library` by Adafruit
   - `Adafruit Unified Sensor`
   - `LiquidCrystal_I2C` or compatible

2. Set Wi-Fi and Blynk credentials in the code:
```cpp
char ssid[] = "YourWiFiName";
char pass[] = "YourWiFiPassword";
#define BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN "Your_Blynk_Token"
```

3. Upload the code using the ESP32 Dev Board settings:
   - Board: ESP32 Dev Module
   - Flash Mode: QIO
   - Partition Scheme: Default
   - Upload Speed: 115200

###  Blynk Dashboard Setup (Blynk IoT - new version):

1. Go to [Blynk IoT](https://blynk.cloud/dashboard/)
2. Create a new Template:
   - Template Name: `Smart Irrigation`
   - Hardware: ESP32 Dev Board
   - Connection Type: WiFi

3. Add Data Streams:
   - V0 → Soil Moisture (Integer)
   - V1 → Temperature (Float)
   - V2 → Humidity (Float)
   - V3 → Manual Pump Switch (Boolean)

4. Add Widgets to Web or Mobile Dashboard:
   - **Gauge** → V0 (Label: Soil %)
   - **Gauge** → V1 (Label: Temperature °C)
   - **Gauge** → V2 (Label: Humidity %)
   - **Switch** → V3 (Manual Control)

5. Link Template to a Device with your Auth Token.

6. Download Blynk App (Android/iOS) and log in using the same account. Your device dashboard will appear automatically.

###  Working Principle:

- Reads temperature and humidity from the DHT22 sensor.
- Reads soil moisture level from the analog soil sensor.
- Automatically turns ON the pump if soil moisture is below 40%.
- Allows manual override of pump using Blynk Switch (V3).
- Displays all values on LCD:
  - Line 1: Temperature, Humidity
  - Line 2: Soil Moisture %, Pump Mode

---

###  Code Explanation Highlights:

- `analogRead(SOIL_PIN)` reads soil sensor value.
- `map()` converts analog reading to % (0 to 100).
- Auto mode activates relay if soil < threshold and manual is off.
- `digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW)` turns pump ON (Active LOW).
- `Blynk.virtualWrite()` sends data to the dashboard.

---

###  Helpful Tips:

- Use separate power for motor/pump to avoid ESP32 resets.
- Always connect all GNDs together (ESP32, pump, sensors).
- Tune soil moisture thresholds based on your sensor response.
- Keep DHT22 protected from direct water/moisture.

---

### Testing:

1. Power on the ESP32.
2. Open Serial Monitor to debug readings.
3. Watch values on LCD and Blynk.
4. Try placing the soil sensor in dry vs. wet soil.
5. Use Blynk Switch to toggle manual control.
